## Learnings üß†



-   Technical Skill: I learned how to implement data aggregation and transformation using the pandas library. For example, I used the requests library to efficiently handle API calls.

Challenge: One major challenge was handling missing values and inconsistent data types within the dataset, which I solved by implementing a pre-processing function that cleans the data by filling null values with the column's median and standardizing data formats.

Key Takeaway: My main takeaway is the importance of version control using Git for building robust applications.
